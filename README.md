# Underwriting-AIG
(this is virtual experience from www.forage.com)

## TASK 1
As an underwriter on AIG’s healthcare team (Lexington Healthcare), you have been asked by one of your broker partners to attend a crucial relationship-building meeting with the broker and potential insured. During this meeting, you will present the insurance product and the competitive advantages of AIG's healthcare team. You will prepare a one-page overview slide with key details about the healthcare team, present it to the potential insured, and take them to a business dinner following the meeting.
- Gather information about AIG(Lexington Healthcare)
- Identify the key strengths of Lexington Healthcare
- Organize the information you have gathered into a clear and concise format on a one-page powerpoint slide

## TASK 2
This task will have you go through the process of underwriting a healthcare submission using a mix of qualitative and quantitative tools according to the company’s underwriting guidelines. Remember, the insurance coverage here covers the liability of medical malpractice for healthcare providers.
Open up the “Submission File.”
Review the coverage specifics, including the size of the limits, the type of coverage, and the deductible.
 
a. Open the “Lexington Healthcare Rating Tool.”
Review the underwriting guidelines. Once you are familiar with the coverage types and definitions, you can begin reviewing the application and financials.
 
b. Check the application.
Make sure it’s complete and none of the answers result in an automatic declination of coverage according to the underwriting guidelines.

c. If you determine the risk acceptable, you can move on to preparing the rating tool using the information provided in the submission.
 
d. Enter the basic information. 
Include limits, deductibles, effective dates, and the exposures that are used to price the risk. Review the claims history from the application and select the number of claims.
 
e. Choose whether to modify the pricing. 
Use your own underwriting authority by either debiting (making coverage more expensive) or crediting (reducing) the base rates. This modification is based on your qualitative observations of the risk on things like the financial strength of the insured, evidence of a risk management program, loss history, etc.
 
f. Type in the underwriting summary. 
Include a brief description of the insured and your reasoning behind the underwriter modification if used. The summary should be no more than 3-4 sentences

The final step is to prepare the formal quote using the "Quote Template".
